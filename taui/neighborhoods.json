It consists of four buildings: Lt. Eleazer Davis Elementary (K-2), Lt. Job Lane Elementary (3-5), John Glenn Middle School (6-8), and Bedford High School (9-12). Some students from Hanscom Air Force Base, which is partially located in Bedford, join Bedford residents at Bedford High for 9th grade and beyond.

Boxborough has one elementary school, Blanchard Memorial School. Blanchard Memorial School consistently achieves MCAS (Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System) test scores within the top ten of Massachusetts school districts. In the school year starting September 2014, the elementary school became part of the Acton-Boxborough Regional School District as a result of a town vote. Children living in Boxborough have priority for attendance, with any remaining spaces available for Acton children. Prior to this, only upon reaching Junior high (grades 7–8) did students become part of the regional system, attending school in the neighboring town of Acton. Acton-Boxborough Regional High School (ABRHS) is highly ranked within Massachusetts and nationwide. The U.S. Department of Education designated the institution as a Blue Ribbon School in 2009. In 2008, Newsweek magazine ranked ABRHS as one of the best high schools in the country.

It is primarily a mature suburban, residential community with urban characteristics. The Town of Brookline continues to be a safe and highly desirable place to live, due to its proximity to job opportunities, excellent public transportation and school systems, and livable neighborhoods that balance green space, historic preservation, and outstanding commercial services. Surrounded by the City of Boston on three sides, Brookline consists of roughly six square miles of land and is home to a population of about 58,732 people. The town is served by the Public Schools of Brookline. The student body at Brookline High School includes students from more than 50 countries. Many students attend Brookline High from surrounding neighborhoods in Boston such as Mission Hill and Mattapan through the Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity (METCO) system. There are eight elementary schools in the Brookline Public School system: Baker School, Coolidge Corner School, Driscoll, Heath, Lawrence, Lincoln, Pierce, and Runkle. As of December 2006, there were 6,089 K-12 students enrolled in the Brookline public schools. The system includes one early learning center, eight grades K-8 schools, and one comprehensive high school. The Old Lincoln School is a surplus building used by the town to temporarily teach students in when another school building is being renovated. It was rented in 2009 as the venue for the play Sleep No More. Brookline is served by the C and D branches of the MBTA's Green Line trains, with inbound service to downtown Boston and outbound service to Newton.

Lakeville operates several schools for its school aged population. Assawompsett Elementary School is operated by the town for grades K-3. The George R. Austin Intermediate School is operated jointly with Freetown for grade 4 and 5. Freetown-Lakeville Middle School is operated jointly with Freetown for grades 6-8, and Apponequet Regional High School is jointly operated with Freetown for grades 9-12. In addition to its highways, the terminus of the Middleborough-Lakeville Line of the MBTA's commuter rail is along the town's border (the rail itself passes along the town line; the parking lots are entirely within Lakeville). There is also a spur off that line, heading due west to Taunton, which is operated by CSX Transportation. This spur links the two main lines of the railroad in southeastern Massachusetts; the easternmost heads to Cape Cod via the line used by the MBTA, and the westernmost proceeds to split in Taunton, sending two lines towards Fall River and New Bedford, respectively. The New Bedford line also passes through the town on its west side.", "town_link": "https:\/\/www.lakevillema.org\/", "wikipedia": null, "wikipedia_link": "https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lakeville,_Massachusetts", "street": null, "school": null, "town_square": "https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:Old_Lakeville_Public_Library,_MA.jpg", "open_space_or_landmark": "https:\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/File:The_Reservoir,_North_Lakeville_MA.jpg", "zviolentcrimeflip": 0.545629, "crime_percentile": 63.0, "street_thumbnail": null, "street_license": null, "street_license_url": null, "street_description": null, "street_artist": null, "street_username": null, "school_thumbnail": null, "school_license": null, "school_license_url": null, "school_description": null, "school_artist": null, "school_username": null, "town_square_thumbnail": "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/3\/3e\/Old_Lakeville_Public_Library%2C_MA.jpg\/120px-Old_Lakeville_Public_Library%2C_MA.jpg", "town_square_license": "CC BY 3.0", "town_square_license_url": "https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/3.0", "town_square_description": "Old Lakeville Public Library, MA", "town_square_artist": "<a href=\"\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/User:Faolin42\" title=\"User:Faolin42\">John Phelan<\/a>", "town_square_username": "Faolin42", "open_space_or_landmark_thumbnail": "https:\/\/upload.wikimedia.org\/wikipedia\/commons\/thumb\/c\/cb\/The_Reservoir%2C_North_Lakeville_MA.jpg\/120px-The_Reservoir%2C_North_Lakeville_MA.jpg", "open_space_or_landmark_license": "CC BY-SA 3.0", "open_space_or_landmark_license_url": "https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by-sa\/3.0", "open_space_or_landmark_description": "The Reservoir, North Lakeville MA", "open_space_or_landmark_artist": "<a href=\"\/\/commons.wikimedia.org\/wiki\/User:Faolin42\" title=\"User:Faolin42\">John Phelan<\/a>", "open_space_or_landmark_username": "Faolin42" }, "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [ -70.9269, 41.8718 ] } },
