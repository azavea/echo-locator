    ImportanceSchools: 'ECHO’s information on school quality comes from the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. Our metric balances both an overall measure of school quality across each ZIP Code, as well as the Department’s 2018-2019 Accountability Metrics and “Economically Disadvantaged” Growth Metrics, which gauge school-wide achievement and academic growth among disadvantaged students, respectively. These data include public schools, but not private, charter, vocational, technical, or virtual institutions.',
