Wrap-around care will be offered at all five elementary schools for students in grades K-5, both before and after school.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winchester,_Massachusetts",https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:WinchesterMA_WedgemereHD_2.jpg,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/92/Book_Ends_-_Winchester%2C_MA_-_DSC04163.JPG,https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Downtown_winchester_MA.jpg,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Mill_Pond%2C_Winchester_MA.jpg,98,1750,1925,2350,2925,3150,3600,4075,,-71.1463,42.4519,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/92/Book_Ends_-_Winchester%2C_MA_-_DSC04163.JPG/120px-Book_Ends_-_Winchester%2C_MA_-_DSC04163.JPG,CC0,http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.en,"Book Ends - Winchester, MA - DSC04163","<a href=""//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Daderot"" title=""User:Daderot"">Daderot</a>",Daderot,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/66/Mill_Pond%2C_Winchester_MA.jpg/120px-Mill_Pond%2C_Winchester_MA.jpg,CC BY 3.0,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0,"Mill Pond, Winchester MA","<a href=""//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Faolin42"" title=""User:Faolin42"">John Phelan</a>",Faolin42,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/WinchesterMA_WedgemereHD_2.jpg/120px-WinchesterMA_WedgemereHD_2.jpg,CC BY-SA 4.0,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0,WinchesterMA WedgemereHD 2,"<a href=""//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Magicpiano"" title=""User:Magicpiano"">User:Magicpiano</a>",Magicpiano,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/de/Downtown_winchester_MA.jpg/120px-Downtown_winchester_MA.jpg,CC BY 3.0,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0,Downtown winchester MA,"<a href=""//commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Moonshine4711&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1"" class=""new"" title=""User:Moonshine4711 (page does not exist)"">Moonshine4711</a>",Moonshine4711

Brookline,02446,1,1,1,91,0,25470,5,1,42.3437,-71.1215,"Located four miles from downtown Boston, in Norfolk County, Brookline is one of the largest towns in New England. It is primarily a mature suburban, residential community with urban characteristics. The Town of Brookline continues to be a safe and highly desirable place to live, due to its proximity to job opportunities, excellent public transportation and school systems, and livable neighborhoods that balance green space, historic preservation, and outstanding commercial services. Surrounded by the City of Boston on three sides, Brookline consists of roughly six square miles of land and is home to a population of about 58,732 people. The town is served by the Public Schools of Brookline. The student body at Brookline High School includes students from more than 50 countries. Many students attend Brookline High from surrounding neighborhoods in Boston such as Mission Hill and Mattapan through the Metropolitan Council for Educational Opportunity (METCO) system. There are eight elementary schools in the Brookline Public School system: Baker School, Coolidge Corner School, Driscoll, Heath, Lawrence, Lincoln, Pierce, and Runkle. As of December 2006, there were 6,089 K-12 students enrolled in the Brookline public schools. The system includes one early learning center, eight grades K-8 schools, and one comprehensive high school. The Old Lincoln School is a surplus building used by the town to temporarily teach students in when another school building is being renovated. It was rented in 2009 as the venue for the play Sleep No More. Brookline is served by the C and D branches of the MBTA's Green Line trains, with inbound service to downtown Boston and outbound service to Newton.

Newton,02458,1,1,1,88,0,2758,5,1,42.3526,-71.1876,"Newton is a suburban city in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States. It is approximately 7 miles west of downtown Boston and is bordered by Boston's Brighton and West Roxbury neighborhoods to the east and south, respectively, and by the suburb of Brookline to the east, the suburbs of Watertown and Waltham to the north, and Weston, Wellesley and Needham to the west. Rather than having a single city center, Newton resembles a patchwork of thirteen villages. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the population of Newton was 85,146, making it the eleventh largest city in the state. Located just outside of Boston, Newton is well respected for the quality of education, community life, exceptional homes, and beautiful open spaces. Newton has frequently been voted as one of the 10 best communities to live in. Newton's proximity to Boston, along with its good public schools and safe and quiet neighborhoods, make it a very desirable community for those who commute to Boston or work in Newton's businesses and industries. Newton is well-served by three modes of mass transit run by the MBTA: light rail, commuter rail, and bus service. The Green Line ""D"" Branch, (also known as the Riverside branch) is a light rail line running through the center of the city that makes very frequent trips to downtown Boston, ranging from 10 to 30 minutes away. The Green Line ""B"" Branch ends across from Boston College on Commonwealth Avenue, virtually at the border of Boston's Brighton neighborhood and the City of Newton (an area which encompasses an unincorporated suburban village referred to as Chestnut Hill). The MBTA Worcester commuter rail, serving the northern villages of Newton that are proximate to Waltham, offers less frequent service to Boston.

Weston,02493,1,1,1,100,0,79,2,2,42.3719,-71.2899,"Weston is a town in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, about 15 miles west of downtown Boston. The population of Weston, as of June 2017, was 11,389. A small community in the Metro West area and on the perimeter of the metropolitan Boston area, the Town of Weston prides itself on the quiet, country-like setting and excellent school system. Weston is situated in the greater Boston area, which has excellent rail, air, and highway facilities. Commuter rail service to North Station, Boston, is available from Hastings and Kendal Green. Since 1969 Weston has participated in the Metco program, a voluntary busing program that brings minority students from Boston to suburban schools. Since 1999, Weston Windows, an integrated preschool, with classrooms at Woodland and Country Schools, has fulfilled the town's mandate to educate children with special needs from the age of 3. The Elementary programs are designed to take advantage of the natural curiosity of children. The emphasis is on flexibility and individualization of instruction. The Upper Elementary, grades 4 and 5, builds the academic and social independence of Middle School where students are still nurtured by the homeroom structure as students begin to have greater responsibilities for homework and extra-curricular activities. The Middle School program is organized in a house system, with students in each house sharing the same set of subject matter teachers. This arrangement allows for a more personal and supervised education appropriate for young adolescents. Weston High School offers its students a comprehensive and diversified program. SAT Scores at Weston High School are consistently among the top public schools in Massachusetts and College Placements are consistently near the top in Massachusetts in percentage of public school graduates entering four-year colleges. Weston is also a part of the Minuteman High School district, a 4-year vocational high school located in Lexington. As for public transportation, Weston is directly served by three MBTA Commuter Rail stations — Silver Hill, Hastings and Kendal Green — all on the Fitchburg Commuter Rail Line, with an inbound terminus at Boston's North Station while outbound service heads to Wachusett Station in the city of Fitchburg. Two of those three stations (Silver Hill and Hastings), however, are only served near or during rush hour periods with no weekend service.",https://www.weston.org/,"A small community in the Metro West area and on the perimeter of the metropolitan Boston area, the Town of Weston prides itself on the quiet, country-like setting and excellent school system.Weston is situated in the greater Boston area, which has excellent rail, air, and highway facilities.
