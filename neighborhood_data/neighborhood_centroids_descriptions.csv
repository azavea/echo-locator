Blanchard Memorial School consistently achieves MCAS (Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System) test scores within the top ten of Massachusetts school districts. In the school year starting September 2014, the elementary school became part of the Acton-Boxborough Regional School District as a result of a town vote. Children living in Boxborough have priority for attendance, with any remaining spaces available for Acton children. Prior to this, only upon reaching Junior high (grades 7–8) did students become part of the regional system, attending school in the neighboring town of Acton. Acton-Boxborough Regional High School (ABRHS) is highly ranked within Massachusetts and nationwide. The U.S. Department of Education designated the institution as a Blue Ribbon School in 2009. In 2008, Newsweek magazine ranked ABRHS as one of the best high schools in the country. Also, the school has ranked in the top ten for the National Academic Decathlon.",http://www.boxborough-ma.gov/,,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxborough,_Massachusetts","https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Levi_Wetherbee_Farm,_Boxborough_MA.jpg","https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Boxborough_Town_Hall,_MA.jpg",https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ABRHS.jpg,https://www.flickr.com/photos/calliope/6243751876,53,1450,1600,1875,2350,2525,2900,3600,,-71.5116,42.5025,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3e/Boxborough_Town_Hall%2C_MA.jpg/120px-Boxborough_Town_Hall%2C_MA.jpg,CC BY 3.0,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0,"Boxborough Town Hall, MA","<a href=""//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Faolin42"" title=""User:Faolin42"">John Phelan</a>",Faolin42,,,,,,,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Levi_Wetherbee_Farm%2C_Boxborough_MA.jpg/120px-Levi_Wetherbee_Farm%2C_Boxborough_MA.jpg,CC BY 3.0,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0,"Levi Wetherbee Farm, Boxborough MA","<a href=""//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Faolin42"" title=""User:Faolin42"">John Phelan</a>",Faolin42,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3f/ABRHS.jpg/120px-ABRHS.jpg,CC-BY-SA-3.0,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/,ABRHS,Jameson Williams,Sarregouset

Assawompsett Elementary School is operated by the town for grades K-3. The George R. Austin Intermediate School is operated jointly with Freetown for grade 4 and 5. Freetown-Lakeville Middle School is operated jointly with Freetown for grades 6-8, and Apponequet Regional High School is jointly operated with Freetown for grades 9-12. In addition to its highways, the terminus of the Middleborough-Lakeville Line of the MBTA's commuter rail is along the town's border (the rail itself passes along the town line; the parking lots are entirely within Lakeville). There is also a spur off that line, heading due west to Taunton, which is operated by CSX Transportation. This spur links the two main lines of the railroad in southeastern Massachusetts; the easternmost heads to Cape Cod via the line used by the MBTA, and the westernmost proceeds to split in Taunton, sending two lines towards Fall River and New Bedford, respectively.

Newton,02458,1,1,0.7819991,1,85,0,2758,5,1,42.3526,-71.1876,"Newton is a suburban city in Middlesex County, Massachusetts, United States. It is approximately 7 miles west of downtown Boston and is bordered by Boston's Brighton and West Roxbury neighborhoods to the east and south, respectively, and by the suburb of Brookline to the east, the suburbs of Watertown and Waltham to the north, and Weston, Wellesley and Needham to the west. Rather than having a single city center, Newton resembles a patchwork of thirteen villages. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the population of Newton was 85,146, making it the eleventh largest city in the state. Located just outside of Boston, Newton is well respected for the quality of education, community life, exceptional homes, and beautiful open spaces. Newton has frequently been voted as one of the 10 best communities to live in. Newton's proximity to Boston, along with its good public schools and safe and quiet neighborhoods, make it a very desirable community for those who commute to Boston or work in Newton's businesses and industries. Newton is well-served by three modes of mass transit run by the MBTA: light rail, commuter rail, and bus service. The Green Line ""D"" Branch, (also known as the Riverside branch) is a light rail line running through the center of the city that makes very frequent trips to downtown Boston, ranging from 10 to 30 minutes away. The Green Line ""B"" Branch ends across from Boston College on Commonwealth Avenue, virtually at the border of Boston's Brighton neighborhood and the City of Newton (an area which encompasses an unincorporated suburban village referred to as Chestnut Hill). The MBTA Worcester commuter rail, serving the northern villages of Newton that are proximate to Waltham, offers less frequent service to Boston. It runs from every half-an-hour during peak times to every couple of hours otherwise. The northern villages are also served by frequent express buses that go to downtown Boston via the Massachusetts Turnpike as well as Waltham.Newton also has east-west and north-south highway infrastructure with Routes 90 and 95 running through the city.",http://www.newtonma.gov/about/default.asp,,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton,_Massachusetts","https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Windermere_Rd,_Newton_MA.jpg",https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Newton_North_High_School_and_Tiger_Drive.agr.jpg,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Lincoln_St,_Newton_Highlands_MA.jpg","https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bullough%27s_Pond,_Newton_MA.jpg",84,1950,2200,2675,3350,3625,4200,4600,,-71.1876,42.3526,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Newton_North_High_School_and_Tiger_Drive.agr.jpg/120px-Newton_North_High_School_and_Tiger_Drive.agr.jpg,CC BY-SA 4.0,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0,Newton North High School and Tiger Drive.agr,"<a href=""//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:ArnoldReinhold"" title=""User:ArnoldReinhold"">ArnoldReinhold</a>",ArnoldReinhold,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Bullough%27s_Pond%2C_Newton_MA.jpg/120px-Bullough%27s_Pond%2C_Newton_MA.jpg,CC BY 3.0,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0,"Bullough's Pond, Newton MA","<a href=""//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Faolin42"" title=""User:Faolin42"">John Phelan</a>",Faolin42,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c2/Windermere_Rd%2C_Newton_MA.jpg/120px-Windermere_Rd%2C_Newton_MA.jpg,CC BY 3.0,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0,"Windermere Rd, Newton MA","<a href=""//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Faolin42"" title=""User:Faolin42"">John Phelan</a>",Faolin42,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e3/Lincoln_St%2C_Newton_Highlands_MA.jpg/120px-Lincoln_St%2C_Newton_Highlands_MA.jpg,CC BY 3.0,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0,"Lincoln St, Newton Highlands MA","<p><a href=""//commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Faolin42"" title=""User:Faolin42"">John Phelan</a>

Weston is situated in the greater Boston area, which has excellent rail, air, and highway facilities. Commuter rail service to North Station, Boston, is available from Hastings and Kendal Green. Since 1969 Weston has participated in the Metco program, a voluntary busing program that brings minority students from Boston to suburban schools. Since 1999, Weston Windows, an integrated preschool, with classrooms at Woodland and Country Schools, has fulfilled the town's mandate to educate children with special needs from the age of 3. The Elementary programs are designed to take advantage of the natural curiosity of children. The emphasis is on flexibility and individualization of instruction. The Upper Elementary, grades 4 and 5, builds the academic and social independence of Middle School where students are still nurtured by the homeroom structure as students begin to have greater responsibilities for homework and extra-curricular activities.
